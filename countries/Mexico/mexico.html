            <p>Chichen Itza is one of the most famous Mayan archaeological sites located in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.</p>
            <p>Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.
                <br>
                Chichén Itzá was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature.[2] The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.[3]</p>

            <h2>Teotihuacan</h2>

            <p>Teotihuacan, known as the "City of the Gods," features the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon.</p>
            <p>Teotihuacan is known today as the site of many of the most architecturally significant Mesoamerican pyramids built in the pre-Columbian Americas, namely the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. Although close to Mexico City, Teotihuacan was not a Mexica (i.e. Aztec) city, and it predates the Mexica Empire by many centuries. At its zenith, perhaps in the first half of the first millennium (1 CE to 500 CE), Teotihuacan was the largest city in the Americas, with a population of at least 25,000,[3] but has been estimated at 125,000 or more,[4][5] making it at least the sixth-largest city in the world during its epoch.[6]
                <br>
                The city covered eight square miles (21 km2)  and 80 to 90 percent of the total population of the valley resided in Teotihuacan. Apart from the pyramids, Teotihuacan is also anthropologically significant for its complex, multi-family residential compounds, the Avenue of the Dead, and its vibrant, well-preserved murals. Additionally, Teotihuacan exported fine obsidian tools found throughout Mesoamerica. The city is thought to have been established around 100 BCE, with major monuments continuously under construction until about 250 CE.[4] The city may have lasted until sometime between the 7th and 8th centuries CE, but its major monuments were sacked and systematically burned around 550 CE. Its collapse might be related to the extreme weather events of 535–536.</p>

            <h2>Cancun</h2>

        </div>
            <p>Famous for its beautiful beaches and vibrant nightlife, Cancun is a top tourist destination.</p>
            <p>The name Cancún, Cancum or Cankun first appears on 18th-century maps.[7] In older English-language documents, the city's name is sometimes spelled Cancoon, an attempt to convey the sound of the name.[8]
                <br>
                Cancún is derived from the Mayan name kàan kun, composed of kàan 'snake' and the verb kum ~ kun 'to swell, overfill'.[9] Two translations have been suggested: the first is 'nest of snakes' and the second, less accepted one is 'place of the golden snake'.[10] Snake iconography was prevalent at the pre-Columbian site of Nizuc.[6]
                <br>
                The shield of the municipality of Benito Juárez, which represents the city of Cancún, was designed by the Mexican-American artist Joe Vera.[11] It is divided into three parts: the color blue symbolizes the Caribbean Sea, the yellow the sand and the red the sun with its rays.</p>
